		<p>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.[1][2] Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.</p><br><br>
		<p>As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[3], and in a well-defined formal language[4] for calculating a function.[5] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[6] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[7] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"[8] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[9]</p><br><br>
		<p>The concept of algorithm has existed since antiquity. Arithmetic algorithms, such as a division algorithm, was used by ancient Babylonian mathematicians circa 2500 BC and Egyptian mathematicians circa 1550 BC.[10] Greek mathematicians later used algorithms in the sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers[11], and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.[12] Arabic mathematicians such as Al-Kindi in the 9th century used cryptographic algorithms for code-breaking, based on frequency analysis.[13]</p><br><br>
		<p>The word algorithm itself is derived from the 9th-century Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, Latinized Algoritmi.[14] A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "effective calculability"[15] or "effective method".[16] Those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–37 and 1939.</p><br><br>
		<p>The word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi in the first steps to algorismus.[17][18] Al-Khwārizmī (Arabic: الخوارزمي‎, Persian: خوارزمی‎, c. 780–850) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad[11], whose name means 'the native of Khwarazm', a region that was part of Greater Iran and is now in Uzbekistan.[19][20]</p>
